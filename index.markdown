The Steinmann Group is part of [Applied Supramolecular Chemistry](https://www.en.bio.aau.dk/research/applied-supramolecual-chemistry/) at Aalborg University.
We have three areas of focus which are <em>Inclusion Complexes</em>, <em>Light-Matter Interaction</em> and <em>Exploration of Chemical Space</em>, the latter with a special focus on machine-learning techniques.

The Steinmann Group runs the [computational chemistry](https://www.en.bio.aau.dk/research/applied-supramolecual-chemistry/computational-chemistry/) aspect of the applied supramolecular chemistry group.
