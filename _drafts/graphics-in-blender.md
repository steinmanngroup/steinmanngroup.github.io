I have recently found [a series of interesting Youtube videos](https://twitter.com/bradyajohnston) by [Brady Johnston](https://twitter.com/bradyajohnston) on generating high-quality graphics for (bio-)chemistry and related fields in a 3D program called [blender](http://www.blender.org).
From my perspective, the whole thing that made it click was the possiblity of importing molecular structures from either Pymol or [ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) and at least somewhat easier to work with.

![Cholesterol bound to Cyclodextrin](/assets/img/graphics_in_blender.jpg "cholesterol bound to cyclodextrin")

The two first videos on Brady's channel cover the basics of navigating the blender interface which is incredibly intimidating. However, he goes over basic concepts and it is quite easy to follow along. The picture above was made using blender with the cholesterol molecule and cyclodextrin surface extracted from ChimeraX.

Now I just need a new graphics card.
